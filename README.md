# Case-Study-02-Credit-Card-Debt-Pay-Off

In this case study, we write a program that calculates a 'fixed' minimum monthly payment for a credit card debt to be paid off in a year based on the user input about the unpaid debt and relevant rates. A simple calculation shows that the debt cannot be paid off simply by paying the minimum monthly payments set by a credit card company. In addition, we use the 'bisection' search algorithm to make the program faster.
