    "Each month, a credit card statement will come with the option for you to pay a minimum amount of your charge, usually 2% of the balance due. However, the credit card company earns money by charging interest on the balance that you don't pay. So even if you pay credit card payments on time, interest is still accruing on the outstanding balance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Say you've made a $5,000 purchase on a credit card with an 18 percent annual interest rate and a 2 percent minimum monthly payment rate. If you only pay the minimum monthly amount for a year, how much is the remaining balance?\n",
    "\n",
    "You can think about this in the following way.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the beginning of month 0 (when the credit card statement arrives), assume you owe an amount we will call $b_0$ (b for balance; subscript 0 to indicate this is the balance at month 0).\n",
    "\n",
    "Any payment you make during that month is deducted from the balance. Let's call the payment you make in month 0, $p_0$. Thus, your \"unpaid balance\" for month 0, $ub_0$, is equal to $b_0 - p_0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ub_0 = b_0 - p_0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "At the beginning of month 1, the credit card company will charge you interest on your unpaid balance. So if your annual interest rate is $r$, then at the beginning of month 1, your new balance is your previous unpaid balance $ub_0$, \"plus\" the interest on this unpaid balance for the month. In algebra, this new balance would be\n",
    "\n",
    "$$b_1 = ub_0 + \\frac{r}{12}.ub_0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In month 1, we will make another payment, $p_1$. That payment has to cover some of the interest costs, so it does not completely go towards paying off the original charge. The balance at the beginning of month 2, $b_2$, can be calculated by first calculating the unpaid balance after paying $p_1$, then by adding the interest accrued:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{eqnarray}\n",
    "\\nonumber ub_1 &=&  b_1 - p_1 \\\\\n",
    "\\nonumber b_2 &=&  ub_1 + \\frac{r}{12}.ub_1\n",
    "\\end{eqnarray}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If you choose just to pay off the minimum monthly payment each month, you will see that the compound interest will dramatically reduce your ability to lower your debt.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at an example. If you've got a $5,000 balance on a credit card with 18% annual interest rate, and the minimum monthly payment is 2% of the current balance, we would have the following repayment schedule if you only pay the minimum payment each month:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Month | Balance | Minimum Payment\t| Unpaid Balance | Interest |\n",
    "| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n",
    "| 0\t| 5000.00 | 100 (= 5000 * 0.02) | 4900 (= 5000 - 100) | 73.50 (= 0.18/12.0 * 4900) |\n",
    "| 1\t| 4973.50 (= 4900 + 73.50) |99.47 (= 4973.50 * 0.02) | 4874.03 (= 4973.50 - 99.47) | 73.11 (= 0.18/12.0 * 4874.03) |\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see that a lot of your payment is going to cover interest, and if you work this through month 12, you will see that after a year, you will have paid 1165.63 dollars and yet you will still owe 4691.11 dollars on what was originally a 5000.00 dollars debt. Pretty depressing!"

    "You'll notice that in Problem 2, your monthly payment had to be a multiple of 10 (in dollars). Why did we make it that way? You can try running your code locally so that the payment can be any dollar and cent amount (in other words, the monthly payment is a multiple of $0.01). Does your code still work? It should, but you may notice that your code runs more slowly, especially in cases with very large balances and interest rates. \n",

    "To recap the problem: we are searching for the smallest monthly payment such that we can pay off the entire balance within a year. What is a reasonable **lower bound** for this payment value? \\$0 is the obvious answer, but you can do better than that. If there was no interest, the debt can be paid off by monthly payments of one-twelfth of the original balance, so we must pay at least this much every month. One-twelfth of the original balance is a good lower bound.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is a good **upper bound**? Imagine that instead of paying monthly, we paid off the entire balance at the end of the year. What we ultimately pay must be greater than what we would've paid in monthly installments, because the interest was compounded on the balance we didn't pay off each month. So a good upper bound for the monthly payment would be one-twelfth of the balance, after having its interest compounded monthly for an entire year.\n",

Try it out with large inputs, and notice how fast it is (try the same large inputs in your solution to Problem 2 to compare!). Produce the same return value as you did in Problem 2.\n"
